## About
I am a Computer Scientist graduated from [ESPOL University](http://espol.edu.ec), Game Development Visiting Lecturer at [ESPOL University](http://espol.edu.ec) and game developer at [Freaky Creations](https://twitter.com/freakycreations), both based on Guayaquil, Ecuador. 
I am currently a research member of Distributed Systems Lab directed by [PhD. Cristina Abad](https://sites.google.com/site/cristinaabad/) and I worked on the game [To Leave](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/to-leave-ps4/) as gameplay programmer and PS4 build responsible.

My interests in computer science go from programming languages, systems programming to game development. I was TA of Programming Languages for a year at ESPOL, and before that I was TA of Physics (classical mechanics and electromagnetism) for two years at ESPOL too. This interest on Physics slowly emerged from my freshman year and it paid me off when I started working on video games.
