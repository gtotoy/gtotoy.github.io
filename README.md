## About
I am an undergraduate student at [ESPOL University](http://espol.edu.ec) and game developer at [Freaky Creations](http://freakycreations.net), both based on Guayaquil, Ecuador. 
I am currently a research collaborator in the Systems Research Group directed by [PhD. Cristina Abad](https://sites.google.com/site/cristinaabad/) and I am working on the game _To Leave_ as gameplay programmer and PS4 build responsible.

My interests in computer science go from programming languages, systems programming to game development. I was TA of Programming Languages for a year at ESPOL, and before that I was TA of Physics (classical mechanics and electromagnetism) for two years at ESPOL too. This interest on Physics slowly emerged at my first semesters at the University and it paid me off when I started working on video games.
