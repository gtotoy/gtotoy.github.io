## About
I am an undergraduate student at [ESPOL University](http://espol.edu.ec) and game developer at [Freaky Creations](http://freakycreations.net), both based on Guayaquil, Ecuador. 
My interests in computer science go from programming languages, systems programming to game development. I was teaching assistant of Programming Languages for a year at ESPOL. Besides computer science I was teaching assistant of Physics (classical mechanics and electromagnetism) for two years at ESPOL too.
I am currently working on the game _To Leave_ as gameplay programmer and PS4 build responsible and I am a research collaborator in the Systems Research Group directed by [PhD. Cristina Abad](https://sites.google.com/site/cristinaabad/).
